**Marathon Data Analysis with Python**
Project Overview
* This project provides an in-depth analysis of marathon performance data, focusing on trends related to runner demographics and race metrics. By analyzing factors like age, gender, pace, and finishing times, it highlights the connections between demographic factors and race outcomes. The project is an excellent introduction to data analysis and visualization techniques in sports analytics.

Technologies Used
* Python: Core programming language for data processing.
* Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
* NumPy: Numerical operations.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

Key Features
* Data Cleaning: Prepares raw marathon data by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reveals insights through statistical summaries and visual explorations.
* Visualizations: Engaging charts that illustrate patterns, including:
    *Finish time distributions across age groups and gender.
    *Pace-to-finish time correlations.
    *Demographic insights into performance variations.
